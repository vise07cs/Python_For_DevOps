# Python file opeartions

update a file / read a file / delete a file 

read and write operations are mostly used 

python --> uses inbuilt functions  (open())
       with open("/file-path","r/w")   (r -> read , w -> write)  



task-2 -> update server.conf file automatically when "max-connection" > 200
 algo 

 step1 --> read the file
 ste2 --> create a variable and store the data 
step 3 --> open file in write mode
step 4 --> update max _connections (if conditional)
