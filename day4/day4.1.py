import day4 as day4_2


a=30
b=40
res=day4_2.add(a,b)

print(res)


# the entire function written in  day4.py has been copied as a module in day4_2
# hence when we run this prog ( day4_2 ) we get the same output as day 4


# suppose we want to access only add func , then we will have to use day4_2.add() 


# using module we can use whole functions of the module and some of the  functins also
