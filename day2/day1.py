# python is dynamically typed -->This means that you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable when you create it. The type is determined at runtime based on the assigned value.

# pyhon supports multiple inbuilt functions which are written and managed by python itself.

# **1. Numeric Data Types in Python (int, float):**

# - Python supports two primary numeric data types: `int` for integers and `float` for floating-point numbers.
# - Integers are whole numbers, and floats can represent both whole and fractional numbers.
# - You can perform arithmetic operations on these types, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.
# - Be aware of potential issues with floating-point precision, which can lead to small inaccuracies in calculations.
# - Python also provides built-in functions for mathematical operations, such as `abs()`, `round()`, and `math` module for advanced functions.
