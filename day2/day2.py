#python is a high-level programming language that is easy to read and write.
#python is a functional programming language that allows you to write code in a more natural way.

# python is dynamically typed -->This means that you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable when you create it. The type is determined at runtime based on the assigned value.

# pyhon supports multiple inbuilt functions which are written and managed by python itself.

# you need to learn some inbuilt functions of every dataTypes 

# numeric dataType  --> int / float / complex
# **1. Numeric Data Types in Python (int, float):**

# - Python supports two primary numeric data types: `int` for integers and `float` for floating-point numbers.
# - Integers are whole numbers, and floats can represent both whole and fractional numbers.
# - You can perform arithmetic operations on these types, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.
# - Be aware of potential issues with floating-point precision, which can lead to small inaccuracies in calculations.
# - Python also provides built-in functions for mathematical operations, such as `abs()`, `round()`, and `math` module for advanced functions.


# x=6.5
# y=4.5
# print(x+y)
# print(x-y)
# print(x*y)
# print(round(x/y))
# print(x//y)
# print(x%y)




# print(1+2)

# print("manish")

# x="manish"
# print(x)

# here x is a variable and "mnaish" is a string

#variable is a name that refers to a value.
# A variable is a container for storing data values.
# A variable is created the moment you assign a value to it.  
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
# A variable name cannot start with a number. 
# A variable name can only contain letters, numbers, or underscores.
# A variable name should not use any of the reserved keywords in Python
# ABC=10 and abc=10 are different variables.
# A variable name can be any length.
# A variable name is case-sensitive.
# A variable name can be any length.
# A variable name is case-sensitive.

# [22:27, 03/04/2025] vise: create 5 variables of your choice . Each variable should hold a unique color
# [22:29, 03/04/2025] vise: create a 2 variables num1 and num2 and assign values to it. Now create a 3rd varilable result and display sum, mul, div, sub to it. print all the result
# [22:30, 03/04/2025] vise: study about keywords and note them down in your notebook
