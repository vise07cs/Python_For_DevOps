<!-- What is  a computer  -->

A computer is an electronic device that processes data and performs tasks based on instructions from software/user. 
It takes input (like typing on a keyboard or clicking a mouse), processes that data, and then produces output (such as displaying something on a screen or printing a document). Computers can store, retrieve, and process data, allowing you to perform tasks like writing documents, browsing the internet, playing games, and more. 

 It consists of hardware (physical components like the CPU, memory, and storage) and software (programs and operating systems that run on the hardware)
Computers can perform calculations, store information, and automate tasks



<!-- What is Operating System -->
An operating system (OS) is a special type of software that manages the computer's hardware and software resources. Think of it as the main program that controls how everything works together. The OS handles tasks like recognizing input from the keyboard, sending output to the display, managing files and directories on the storage drives, and controlling peripheral devices like printers. 

<!-- What is programming language -->
Computers fundamentally operate using the binary number system, which consists of only two digits: 0 and 1.

A programming language is a formal set of instructions that allows humans to communicate with computers to perform specific tasks. These languages enable developers to write code that the computer can interpret and execute, facilitating the creation of software applications, websites, and various digital tools

<!-- Categories of Programming Languages: -->
# High-Level Languages
High-Level Languages: These are closer to human languages and are more abstracted from the computer's hardware. They are designed to be easy to read and write. Examples include Python, Java, C++ and C#.​
# Low-Level Languages
Low-Level Languages: These are closer to machine code and provide little abstraction from the computer's hardware. They offer more control over hardware but are more complex to use. Examples include Assembly and Machine Code.

<!-- Compilers and interpreters  -->
​A compiler and an interpreter are both tools used to translate code written in high-level programming languages into machine code that computers can execute. However, they differ in how and when they perform this translation:


# compilers

Translation Process: A compiler converts the entire source code of a program into machine code before the program is executed.​

Execution: After compilation, the program can be run independently without the need for the compiler.​

Speed: Compilation can be time-consuming, but once compiled, the program generally runs faster because it's already in machine code.​

Error Detection: Compilers analyze the entire code and report all errors after the complete code has been compiled, requiring the programmer to fix all errors before execution.​

Examples of Compiled Languages: C, C++, and Go are typically compiled languages.​

# interpreters

Translation Process: An interpreter translates source code into machine code line-by-line during program execution.​

Execution: The program cannot run independently; it requires the interpreter to execute the code.​

Speed: Interpreted programs often run slower because translation occurs during execution.​


Error Detection: Interpreters execute code line-by-line and stop when an error is encountered, allowing programmers to address errors incrementally.​

Examples of Interpreted Languages: Python, JavaScript, and Ruby are commonly interpreted languages.




In summary, compilers translate the entire program into machine code before execution, leading to faster runtime performance but requiring the entire code to be error-free beforehand.


 Interpreters, on the other hand, translate code line-by-line during execution, offering flexibility and ease of debugging at the cost of slower execution speed.


 <!-- How Python codes are executes BTS  -->
 Python is primarily considered an interpreted language, but its execution process involves both compilation and interpretation


# Source Code Compilation to Bytecode:

When you run a Python script, the Python interpreter first compiles the human-readable source code into an intermediate form called bytecode. This bytecode is a low-level representation of your code, optimized for execution. It's important to note that this compilation step is performed automatically and is typically transparent to the user. 

# Bytecode Execution by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM):

The generated bytecode is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). The PVM reads each bytecode instruction and performs the corresponding operations on the computer's hardware. This is where the interpretation happens, as the PVM translates bytecode into machine-level instructions that the hardware can execute


This two-step process allows Python to combine the benefits of both compilation and interpretation:​

Portability: Since bytecode is platform-independent, Python programs can run on any system with a compatible PVM.​

Flexibility: The interpretation step allows for dynamic features like runtime type checking and dynamic binding.


 Ultimately, Python (like all programming languages) must be translated into machine code because computers can only execute machine instructions (binary: 0s and 1s). However, Python itself is a high-level language, which means you write code in a human-readable format, and then it gets translated into machine code in multiple steps.

<!-- what happens when ou write hello world  -->
You write Python code (e.g., print("Hello, World!")).

Python compiles it to bytecode (an intermediate form, not directly machine code).

The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) interprets and runs the bytecode, translating it into actual machine code step by step
